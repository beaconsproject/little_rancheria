## Introduction


## Methods

### 1. Data preparation

The objective to create an analysis-ready database consisting of caribou location data and covariate rasters. The steps include:

- Telemetry data:
	- Acquire, clean, and save caribou location data
	- Examine track outliers, telemetry errors, and autocorrelation timescales of GPS tracks
	- Define seasons i.e., early winter, late winter, fall rut, spring, summer
- Covariate data:
	- Acquire and prepare a set of covariate rasters that have the same resolution, extent, project, and are aligned
	- Acquire and prepare normal and projected bioclimate data

### 2. Movement analysis

Home range estimation

The objective to estimate the autocorrelated home ranges for caribou at the individual and population levels. The steps include:

- ctmm can help us account for telemetry error, autocorrelation and irregular sampling frequencies in animal tracking data
- Convert caribou location data to telemetry objects (include: individual.local.identifier (or tag.local.identifier), timestamp, location.long and location.lat)
- SelectÂ appropriate model(s) for the autocorrelation structure of the data
	- Examine the autocorrelation structure of the telemetry data using variogram analysis
	- Fit and select model based on the initial parameter value guess identified above
- Use model(s) to estimate home range using the autocorrelated kernel density estimator (AKDE)
- Save various models as geopackage

### 3. Habitat analysis

The steps include:

- Develop habitat models: population and individual-levels
- Use models to identify
	- What landscape features do animals seek or avoid during their movements?
	- In which areas of the landscape are animals at risk of predation or disease transmission?
- Interpret models (https://easystats.github.io/report/)
- Terra random forest models: https://rspatial.org/analysis/5-global_regression.html
- Terra gradient boosting models: https://rspatial.org/sdm/index.html

### 4. Connectivity analysis

The steps include:

- Develop a permeability/resistance surface using the previously fitted habitat model.
- Develop a probability of connectivity map using omniscape
- Identify key (seasonal) movement corridors

## Visualizing results

The objective is to develop a (shiny) dashboard to view the results of the various analyses and allow users to explorer the sensitivity of some of the parameters. Functionality includes:

- View estimated seasonal home ranges (present)
- View seasonal probability of occurrence maps (present, future)
- View potential seasonal movement corridors (present, future)
